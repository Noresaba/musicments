        It is made of stained wood, with a convex shell, and there is a ring attached to the shell. The heads are fastened to the drum by large-headed tacks. These drums are known in China as "low war drums". In the early 20th century, highly decorated versions of these drums were imported in large numbers to the United States where they were known as "tom toms" and used as part of early jazz drum kits.

        The Biangu has many different sizes according to its functions, generally, the diameter of the drumhead are 270mm, 330mm, 400mm, 460mm and 540mm and the height of the drum are usually 170mm, 200mm, 240mm, 300mm and 340mm. The drumhead is usually made of wood and leather; there are 2 to 4 metal rings at the waist of the drum. The player uses one or two sticks to play the drum. The Biangu needs two men when played in the army march, with one man carrying the drum on his back and the other playing behind the first man.
